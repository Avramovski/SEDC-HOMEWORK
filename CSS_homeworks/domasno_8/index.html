                    <li>Casio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio(1917-1993), an engineer
                        specializing in fabrication technology. Kashio's first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a
                        finger ring that would hold a cigarette, allowing the wearer to smoke the cigarette down to its
                        nub while also leaving the wearer's hands free. Japan was impoverished immediately following
                        World War II, so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success.
                        After seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in Ginza, Tokyo in 1949, Kashio
                        and his younger brothers (Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio) used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to
                        develop their calculators. Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be
                        operated by hand using a crank or using a motor (see adding machine).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toshio possessed some knowledge of electronics and set out to make a calculator using solenoids.
                        After dozens of prototypes were tested, the desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was
                        Japan's first electro-mechanical calculator. One of the central and more important innovations
                        of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad; at that time other calculators were
                        using a "full keypad", which meant that each place in the number (1s, 10s, 100s, etc ...) had
                        nine keys. Another distinguishing innovation was the use of a single display window instead of
                        the three display windows (one for each argument and one for the answer) used in other
                        calculators. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was formed in June 1957. That year, Casio released the
                        Model 14-A, sold for 485,000 yen,the first all-electric compact calculator, which was based on
                        relay technology.</li>

                <li>The beginning of F-91W
                    <ul>
                        The Casio F-91W is a digital watch manufactured by Japanese electronics company Casio.
                        Introduced in June 1989 as a successor of the F-87W, it is popular for its low price and long
                        battery life. As of 2011, annual production of the watch is 3 million units, which makes it the
                        most sold watch in the world.

                <li>Design
                    <ul>
                        Designed by Ryusuke Moriai as his first design for Casio, the case of the F-91W measures 37.5 by
                        34.5 by 8.5 millimetres (1.48 by 1.36 by 0.33 ). The case is primarily made of resin, with a
                        stainless steel caseback and buttons, with the manufacturer's module number, 593, stamped on the
                        caseback. The resin strap is 18 millimetres (0.71 in) at the fitting and 22 mm across the widest
                        part of the lugs. The total weight is 21 grams (0.74 oz).

                <li>Features
                    <ul>
                        The F-91W is a chronograph, featuring a <sup>1</sup>/100 second stopwatch with a count up to
                        59:59.99 (nearly one hour). The stopwatch also has the feature to mark net and split time (lap).
                        Other features include an hourly time beep and a single daily alarm lasting 20 seconds and an
                        annual calendar, with adjustment for leap years not supported as the watch does not record the
                        year. February is always counted as 28 days. The watch uses a faint, green LED backlight located
                        to the left of the display for illumination (in earlier versions it was an amber microlight).
                        According to manufacturer estimates, the watch is reported to be accurate to Â±30 seconds per
                        month.
